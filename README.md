## Information

QMRITools is developed for [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/).
It contains the following toolboxes:

- CardiacTools
- CoilTools
- DenoiseTools
- DixonTools
- ElastixTools
- GeneralTools
- GradientTools
- ImportTools
- IVIMTools
- JcouplingTools
- MaskingTools
- NiftiTools
- PhysiologyTools
- PlottingTools
- ProcessingTools
- RelaxometryTools
- SimulationTools
- VisteTools

A list off all functions and their help can be found int All-Functions.nb. Documentation of all functions and their options is fully integrated in the Mathematica documentation.
The toolbox always works within the latest version of Mathematica and does not support any backward compatibility.

All code and documentation is maintained and uploaded to github using [Workbench](https://www.wolfram.com/workbench/).

## Install toolbox

Install the toolbox in the Mathematica UserBaseDirectory > Applications.

	FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory, "Applications"}]

Some functions of QMRITools call on external executables and software.
These executables need to be placed in "QMRITools\Applications".
For the latest version of these tools and their user licences please visit their website.

* [dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix/)
	* dcm2niix.exe
* [Elastix](http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/)
	* elastix.exe
	* transformix.exe

All functionality is tested under windows 10 with the latest Mathematica version. 
Elastix compatibility has been tested for MacOSX but is not guaranteed.  

A full build and release can be found [here](https://github.com/mfroeling/QMRITools/blob/master/QMRITools.zip). 

## Using the toolbox

The toolbox can be loaded by using <<QMRITools`

A list of all QMRITools packages is generated by 
	
	QMRIToolsPackages[]

A list of all DTITools functions or functions per toolbox is generated by 

	QMRIToolsFunctions[]
	QMRIToolsFunctions["toolboxname"]
	
To print the documentation of all functions use

	QMRIToolsFuncPrint[]
	QMRIToolsFuncPrint["toolboxname"]
