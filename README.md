## Information

QMRITools is developed for [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/).
It contains the following toolboxes:

- CardiacTools
- CoilTools
- DenoiseTools
- DixonTools
- ElastixTools
- GeneralTools
- GradientTools
- ImportTools
- IVIMTools
- JcouplingTools
- MaskingTools
- NiftiTools
- PhysiologyTools
- PlottingTools
- ProcessingTools
- RelaxometryTools
- SimulationTools
- VisteTools

## Documentation

Documentation of all functions and their options is fully integrated in the Mathematica documentation. The toolbox always works within the latest version of Mathematica and does not support any backward compatibility.
After the toolbox is installed correctly it should show up as a package in the Mathematica add-ons. 

![QMRITools package](https://github.com/mfroeling/QMRITools/blob/master/Images/AddOns.PNG)

All code and documentation is maintained and uploaded to github using [Workbench](https://www.wolfram.com/workbench/).

![Guides QMRITools](https://github.com/mfroeling/QMRITools/blob/master/Images/Guide.PNG)

## Install toolbox

The latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/mfroeling/QMRITools/releases/download/2.0/QMRITools.zip). 

Install the toolbox in the Mathematica UserBaseDirectory > Applications.

	FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory, "Applications"}]

Some functions of QMRITools call on external executables and software.
These executables need to be present in "QMRITools\Applications" and are included in the release.
If for any reason you want to use other (older/newer) versions you can replace them but functionality is not guaranteed.
For the latest version of these tools and their user licences please visit their website.

* [dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix/)
	* dcm2niix.exe
* [Elastix](http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/)
	* elastix.exe
	* transformix.exe

All functionality is tested under windows 10 with the latest Mathematica version. 
Elastix compatibility has been tested for MacOSX but is not guaranteed but we are working on making all tools both Linux and MacOSX compatible.  

## Demonstrations

The repository contains a folder ''Demo'' in which there is a file ``demo.nb``, a folder ``DemoData`` and a folder ``testing. 
To have a global overview of the functionality of the toolbox you can download this folder and run the ``demo.nb``.
By default the ``demo.nb`` looks for the folders ``DemoData`` and ``Testing`` in the same folder as the notebook.

In the first section of the demo notebook the toolbox is loaded and two tests are performed. The first test is to check of all files that are needed to run the toolbox are present. The second test runs after the toolbox is loaded and checks if all the functions and their options that are defined are correct.
 

## Using the toolbox

The toolbox can be loaded by using `` <<QMRITools` ``

A list of all QMRITools packages is generated by 
	
	QMRIToolsPackages[]

A list of all DTITools functions or functions per toolbox is generated by 

	QMRIToolsFunctions[]
	QMRIToolsFunctions["toolboxname"]
	
To print the documentation of all functions use

	QMRIToolsFuncPrint[]
	QMRIToolsFuncPrint["toolboxname"]

A list off all functions and their help can be found in ``All-Functions.nb``.

## Functionality

The toolbox contains over 250 Functions and options of processing and analyzing data.
